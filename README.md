# Overview
UVITA is a real-time UV monitoring system developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, designed to promote sun safety and public health. By leveraging NASA‚Äôs open climate data, UVITA provides accurate, accessible UV index readings to help users make informed decisions about sun exposure. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for our smart UV monitoring solution.

# Features
Real-time UV index monitoring using NASA‚Äôs environmental datasets.
User-friendly interface for displaying UV levels and safety recommendations.
Data processing pipeline for integrating and analyzing UV-related climate data.
Alerts for high UV exposure risks to enhance public health awareness.

# Data Source
UVITA utilizes NASA‚Äôs open climate data, specifically UV radiation and environmental datasets, available through NASA Earth Data. Sample datasets and data-fetching scripts are included in the data/ directory.
